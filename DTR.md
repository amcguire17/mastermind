## DTR: Define the Relationship

Project: Mastermind

Group Member Names: Amanda McGuire and Jacob Piland


What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

  - Learning how to work with others in a pair environment.
  - Solidifying the material from the previous lessons: enumerables, testing, loops, objects and methods.
  - Main goal is to better understand what we are coding.
  - Get better at using pry.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

  - We both come from divide-and-conquer approaches but feel the using the pair programming will better suit the project and our learning styles.
  - Pair programming allows for collaboration in real time.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  - Direct communication and being able to share ideas instantly and then can discuss in detail later.

How would you describe your work style?

  - Amanda: start with trying some code and keep testing it until it works and is efficient. Fast thinker so may need to slow down.
  - Jacob: have some idea written down to be able to go back and evaluate/edit. Likes to think things over before jumping in.

What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

  - Amanda: Fast thinker so will be able to help start things off. Detail oriented.
  - Jacob: Taking time to process and evaluate to edit or come up with a new idea.

Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  NA
How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

  - Collaboration
  - Create a project plan/timeline

How will we overcome obstacles?

  - Direct communication but also able to reach out to other resources and come back to the problem.
  - Break time!

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

  - Most important thing is communication.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

  - Cut off time around 9pm MDT/10pm CST.
  - Prefer evenings to mornings.
  - Meetings with mentors on Monday/Tuesday

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

  - Soft but direct.
  - In person/over zoom feedback.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

  - Things to Solidify: objects, scope, testing, nesting, flow, and Git
  - Feel good about: overall concepts of enumberables, syntax, classes, and methods.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

  - Project plan with timeline
  - Google calendar
  - Making sure github and git are in sync

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

  - If there is something we are stuck on take a 15 minutes to google.
  - Take a short break and try to think about anything else.
  - If we are stuck longer reach out to others (mentors, cohort mates).

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

  -  A project is successful if it mostly works and the tests pass.
  -  Setting up good tests and spending time refactoring code to look cleaner.

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

  - Recognizing that we are learning and when we learn something new celebrate it.
  - Celebration: Playing the game! And happy little treats!
