## DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

  - Learning how to work with others in a pair environment.
  - Solidifying the material from the previous lessons: enumerables, loops, objects and methods.
  - Main goal is to better understand what we are coding.
  - Get better at using pry.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

  - We both come from divide-and-conquer approaches but feel the using the pair programming will better suit the project and our learning styles.
  - Pair programming allows for collaboration in real time.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  - Direct communication and being able to share ideas instantly and then can discuss in detail later.

How would you describe your work style?

  - Amanda: start with trying some code and keep testing it until it works and is efficient. Fast thinker so may need to slow down.
  - Jacob: have some idea written down to be able to go back and evaluate/edit. Likes to think things over before jumping in.

What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

  - Amanda: Fast thinker so will be able to help start things off. Detail oriented.
  - Jacob: Taking time to process and evaluate to edit or come up with a new idea.

What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  NA
How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

  - Collaboration
  - Create a project plan/timeline

How will we overcome obstacles?

  - Direct communication but also able to reach out to other resources and come back to the problem.
  - Break time!

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

  - Most important thing is communication.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

  - Cut off time around 9pm MDT/10pm CST.
  - Prefer evenings to mornings.
  - Meetings with mentors on Monday/Tuesday

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

  - Soft but direct.
  - In person/over zoom feedback.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

  - Things to Solidify: objects, scope, and flow
  - Feel good about: overall concepts of enumberables, syntax, classes, and methods.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

  - Project plan with timeline
  - Google calendar
  - Making sure github and git are in sync

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

  - If there is something we are stuck on take a 15 minutes to google.
  - If we are stuck longer reach out to others (mentors, cohort mates).

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

  -  A project is successful if it mostly works and the tests pass.
  -  Setting up good tests.

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

  - Recognizing that we are learning and when we learn something new celebrate it.
  - Celebration: Happy little treats!

Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine

What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
Template for DTR Memo

Project: Mastermind

Group Member Names: Amanda McGuire and Jacob Piland

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

- Learning how to work with others in a pair environment.
- Solidifying the material from the previous lessons: enumerables, loops, objects and methods.
- Main goal is to better understand what we are coding.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: make sure we communicate and research. If that fails then reach out to others.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): Evenings for collaborating.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): Reach out anytime on slack and try to work on the project daily.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Switch of driver/navigator for testing and classes.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Pomodoro Break Schedule: 45min/10min

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Feedback over zoom or in person.

Additional Remote Considerations: Dog appearances

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): Github/git

Day 1 Agenda: Come up with the project plan and timeline.
