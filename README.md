This program plays MASTERMIND.

Can you break the code???

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. The Codemaker sets a secret code made up of any combination/pattern of pre-determined colors. The Codebreaker tries to solve Secret Code by entering their guess for the correct combination and position of colors. The Codebreaker will receive the number of colors correctly guessed and number of correct positions. The Codebreaker continues taking turns guessing until all of the correct colors and their respective positions have been found.

### Code

This code contains multiple classes and tests to ensure that the game runs properly.
